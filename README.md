## Introduction

The **Solid-Code** project is a learning tool and a practical reference for developers aiming to implement the SOLID principles in real-world applications. These principles promote code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend, making the project ideal for both beginners and experienced developers.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for object-oriented programming that help achieve better software design:

1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle**  
   Each class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
   
2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle**  
   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   
3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   
4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle**  
   No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
   
5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

This project provides curated examples that demonstrate how to implement each of these principles using Ruby and Rails.
